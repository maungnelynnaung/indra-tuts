1. **2024-09-10_pandasgui**: I use both Stata and Python libraries for daily data management activities. I like both but prefer Stata due to its simple and straightforward GUI and features. I use each tool for different purposes and projects. Recently, I looked for a Python Pandas extension that allows browsing and editing cell values, similar to a built-in feature in Stata. After testing several Pandas extensions, I found that “pandasgui” meets my requirements. In this tutorial notebook, I tested the “pandasgui” tool using Stata’s built-in “auto” dataset and reviewed the functionality of the extension.
